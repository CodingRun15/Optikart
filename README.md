# Introduction: 

This project was created towards the Construct Week project presentation goal.
It was a collaborative effort which was created by a team of five. 
#### We created a clone of Lenskart titled Optikart using Bootstrap and a Figma-based webpage using Sass.

# Objectives:
The objective behind creating the Optikart website was to allow users to explore and shop online specs, lenses or other opticals-related utilities which 
is required all the time.
For the figma part, the objective was to create a pixel-perfect design to bridge the gap between a designer a user and a developer.
